# Project to help find missing people.

Current Plan: All pages must be mobile friendly. People will use this more on their mobile then desktop. Also no native app is planned so mobile web should work cleanly.

Two simple pages.

Report a missing person. Ask a picture and information about missing person. Also mobile no. and email-id(optional) of person who is reporting. In case of sighting, he will be contacted.
Sighting : Take a pic of a person, or upload a pic and quickly check if a person was reported missing. incase the person was reported missing, it should alert the person who reported missing and also alert the person who found the person to immediately call Police.

Currently it should save all photographs which were checked for possibly missing.

Use face++ API for face recognition. will figure out how to scale later.

More future ideas in pipeline.
